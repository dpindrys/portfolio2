FULL TRANSCRIPT (with timecode)

00:00:02;09 - 00:00:03;24 | M30
See what the. 

00:00:06;12 - 00:00:42;14 | M1
Beat my thought history. Howdy how did you play. Things like 3000. They're constantly changing over time. So. That fire counter might the taking part counter. Would be history. You know. If you want to do it. It is because you know how to record. A. Summary of. What is the actual care. 

00:00:46;22 - 00:00:58;02 | F13
OK. Well we have. Talked about. I know this is relevant like. Some sort of. Breadcrumb indicator on where this patient is but. I think that. 

00:00:59;16 - 00:01:05;29 | F10
There's more where the provider is in the system rather when the patient is. So we talked about patient location. 

00:01:08;17 - 00:01:33;08 | M30
Tom. Some. Good. News. From. Outside. Actually it isn't good that we're documenting. Here. When the. Isoke summary. And actually this is just new information added to the case summary. 

00:01:34;27 - 00:02:05;15 | M8
From Level 3. It. Is French 26 and 27 we have as part of the case summary. The care that was provided at level 1 and Level 2. So that will still be there. But since the care is. Is done at level 3 at this point. We're adding that. Information as well to the case summary. So we should then have screen shots in. 

00:02:05;28 - 00:02:12;05 | F13
Presentations there that shows the case and I'll take you. OK. What is LPC. 

00:02:16;10 - 00:02:21;14 | M8
Oh like perception. OK. Like. 

00:02:23;12 - 00:02:50;02 | M5
Like perception with Jackson. JACKSON Yes. Yes. So. I. Question. The question that. The major question. In a way that I would put it obviously medical history. In character that you encounter. That he expects to see. These or. Not. 

00:02:50;18 - 00:03:31;21 | M1
Get to see that at that time. What Roger did. Say the surgical procedure that happened prior to the first. That the feasibility of a filter for another time or another time. At one point does the word history because. That happened prior to now. As. He. Said. His there'll be or how does it work because he said. He's really really. Tired Old let's remember the three. Minute. 

00:03:31;26 - 00:03:59;18 | F23
Mark. But. Grizzard. You don't. Ever generated by a clinician and a friend and you know you would have. A diagnosis made by the previous clinician and off the record as never before. With actual history of the history show up in the back that. 

00:04:03;28 - 00:04:04;16 | M22
Yes. 

00:04:07;05 - 00:04:32;27 | M24
Yeah. And the demographics for. So off the streets. Just. Coincide. With. The. Which that should not be aware of a little bit. Confusing. The fear. Of. What happened. 

00:04:33;02 - 00:05:11;29 | F23
To me. You're right it is confusing and I think we need to figure out how to get friendship with the diagnosis category versus. Or history. Is it just more general. Me Let's leave it to. I don't really. I'm wondering does this show that he has a problem with the imagery of the show history industry look like the danger is who's not doing this. And it is hard enough. To. Do. That. 

00:05:12;18 - 00:05:24;14 | M8
Yeah we definitely need to OK. Now actually that. I mean. Under our history. Yeah all that needs. 

00:05:26;21 - 00:05:28;21 | F28
To be changed. That's a. 

00:05:30;02 - 00:06:22;23 | M22
Good time biggest because you know again that should be my goal here for you know like like my son got Rivoire right. You. Know. What's happened with me. I didn't like way that history with activity came with the technology to be. This kind of play way at a very high level. You know. The page. That I Used to go into the tail section of the record. To be just kind of any creepy creature that you give you is you have that sense. I think that would be a valuable. Thing that. Should be a really bad bad or. Good idea and every time something happened. This. Should not be. 

00:06:24;16 - 00:06:50;24 | F10
True. One question I have though is. When we talked a moment ago about referencing the information gathered at Sprint 26 like a lower level provider not content. Wouldn't. Necessarily. Would that content necessarily update down her or would that be accessible more through an individual encounter. No. So whatever that law will provide or docking. It depends. 

00:06:51;11 - 00:07:16;23 | M4
For me it is like us. Like you said this is. What's currently going on with patients. Right. Right. And so it was a preliminary diagnosis made. At level one that was superseded by the three a final diagnosis and level 3. Then. You probably only want to see the top bar the level 3 final NICE's for the patient. 

00:07:16;24 - 00:07:23;26 | M9
Is that correct. Correct. Exactly correct or not. That's by the way. Is droit today. 

00:07:23;27 - 00:08:05;20 | M29
It is not that well both systems. So you end up with either duplication but let's take the sample. You have that dilute the list. Now you have get level 3 you had a diagnosis by or with the Web site. You know class or something like that and what like. That would that would appear there right now. What would be wrong. Would it be the capital of that I would be glad. And. I would be popular you know. Finding that level 3. 

00:08:06;18 - 00:08:49;29 | M28
Would be very good. It should replace the suspect violently with the actual Fido's and with. Yeah that's what happens in a lot of problems and in a lot of EMR is that. The system is responded. To. To. Recognize. You know preliminary diagnoses that we replace them with final diagnoses. Instead it just continues to add both the pulmonary diagnoses there that as the final diagnoses and I answer the diagnoses Ryobi and it becomes a bit of a challenge for the Coalition to sort that out and tell you I was that was the Bolivian he wanted to stop a final one and the same thing for what could be two different things right it could be the first day was something different. 

00:08:50;11 - 00:09:12;22 | M2
Than the second thing. The point is. That that process that is not very well. So our effort down to at least capture some of this is to. As we just said move or a man. This. Banner. Diagnosis to what the level three clinician identified. 

00:09:13;27 - 00:09:42;27 | M6
Is that it should be updated again at 1 5 5. Stay strong. That. Was supposed to be you know the medications are just let's say before the surgery. I would see that being updating the medication list so that there's always like a living. Record. Of the. Status of the active status of the patient. Somewhere in this system the CDC defines. 

00:09:43;23 - 00:10:11;21 | F6
OK. Just going to throw money out there and don't don't they know easy addresses necessarily right now but just something to think about it because of the kind of thinking about like what would be nice user interface was the ability to continue updating on the problem has been the way they freecycling record. Which. Is not accomplished in any time that I've ever seen. And I was thinking about it at the time that you sign your nose which is when you finalize the diagnosis right. 

00:10:11;28 - 00:10:57;23 | F2
You have to put in your diagnosis and then you sign a note confirming that that's really your opinion. Yes. At that point in time you know a window pops up you sign it and it got all the patient's. Problem. Problems. Populating that window. And then somehow it says OK now you've introduced diagnoses. Let's use somehow in a user friendly way either to the diagnosis by dragging it over and replacing something that's on there or just quickly like the League something that is no longer relevant. Like if it almost forces use it or a user friendly way to take like I think it's kind of just. See your diagnosis in light of the other problems other problems must somehow that that that could be really. 

00:10:58;09 - 00:11:02;02 | F6
Helpful. I just I don't know how hard that would be but. 

00:11:04;04 - 00:11:09;14 | M2
That's really my opinion of a really great idea but that's a really great idea. 

00:11:10;18 - 00:11:12;18 | M17
Yeah that's right yeah. 

00:11:12;18 - 00:11:23;04 | F4
So when they're signing off on the record it appears this is the current diagnosis and it's optional for them because you can replace it. 

00:11:23;07 - 00:11:32;03 | M3
You can you can take the words so that they can for whatever you want but you have the right to make it as upset like make one step ahead of another. 

00:11:32;03 - 00:11:51;05 | F2
So for example concretized is a subset of that is psalmody. You don't like it. It lets you relate things to each other and replace and update. I just really didn't know functionality like that in any of my that I've ever seen. That's a really great idea that that had that that would be. Just super. 

00:11:51;19 - 00:11:55;02 | M4
Well. I mean we. Will do it. 

00:11:55;18 - 00:12:00;26 | M5
Well of course not. I. 

00:12:02;02 - 00:13:18;12 | M2
This is Jack. Jack Jack. And you'll see it again. You know probably or the is probably your marks right. Somebody has to do such a good job of keeping that this would be at least a step. In the right direction. There might even be somewhat logical 80 year old that might be there. But I think what choice suggesting it's really a fabulous idea because it could be easily done at the right time. The guys say that your assessment. I'm also going to clear this assessment to the updates that guide them. Right. They should be easy to just do that you know at the same time. So there's a wide number of clicks when you go to. Your body the safest medication. Good guys take medications for your work medication. They want to show reactive active medication. For. The side or replace existence with this distances you're just being added. Or Partridge's you go play you know you know those are operating as a drug. In any case. It give us an opportunity to. Make that decision based decision process. At a time when the documentation of that decision has to be put into a kind of a state of mind. What. Will happen kind of at the same time. Could be a great. 

00:13:18;27 - 00:13:27;03 | F5
Thing. JUDY TIERNEY. Her Go ahead. I just want to distract us from what we're trying to do just get out there you. 

00:13:27;25 - 00:14:01;28 | M4
Know and it's not actually part of a series of his friends will come up. Question one question when you see this being. When the new diagnosis is entered or you mentioned one side or possibly both. Well. I think that I mean I don't know that I still don't fully understand why. Those new diagnoses but. My reasoning leads you to Humar. That. 

00:14:02;22 - 00:14:19;29 | F3
Usually I use diagnoses only get answered at the time that it gets finalized. So like for example eBay will take whatever code you put in there whatever diagnosis you give the patient when you finalize your counter and it'll. Ill pass it on to the public and then you get this problem that has like 30 things on it right. 

00:14:21;14 - 00:14:23;17 | F7
OK. Well. 

00:14:24;29 - 00:14:47;21 | M4
In our system the way we designed it is there's an assessment plan section. And so you know you can go in and you diagnoses the new diagnoses pretty much any time. Without without any kind of know because usually in the heart of the. Ash. That's got. 

00:14:49;04 - 00:14:59;20 | M7
So many. So I don't know if this is a so when they when they make a change to diagnose an existing diagnosis. 

00:14:59;29 - 00:15:24;13 | M4
Or creating a diagnosis that's when you see this pop up. So I don't know if it needs to happen when you enter the new diagnosis is that every plan or when you finalize the note sometimes that you're working on your know you might have a thought in your head of what the diagnosis is and you put it in but you have to finalize your note yet and then you get a result back and you're like oh wait I was wrong and you make change that before you sign your note. 

00:15:25;02 - 00:15:37;26 | F2
Finalized your assessment. So I kind of think maybe. It would be simpler to do it at the time that you finalize the No. Because that's kind of what you're saying. I have a sense of what's going on. I'm putting my name to this. 

00:15:38;15 - 00:15:43;18 | M4
We can show it just believe me when your showing both places. Tell us about it. We. 

00:15:44;19 - 00:15:51;07 | F8
Will and I will question regarding to the the actual displaying of that diagnosis. So. 

00:15:51;23 - 00:16:06;15 | F10
Would it be more like an edit replace whatever exists as a diagnosis. Or does the new diagnosis kind of end up at the top of the list and the prior diagnoses go further down on the list because. I think. 

00:16:07;24 - 00:17:21;08 | F3
I think that it seems like a side by side like you got the problem months prior to the finalizing of that new encounter. And then you've got. Whatever diagnoses. On one side raised the prognosis prior. To the counter and then on the day on the left and on the right hand side you've got the diagnoses that you can treat as a part of your encounter which may be why only one or maybe three or four you know. And then I see that this is like a way that you can. Like it as would you like to just add. On to the existing problem as active diagnoses. Or if not maybe that somehow. You know he needs to eat. That he needs to be outdated like the actual policies that something's deleted. Or. Something replaced by something that's on your list somehow you could drag it over or acts out something that on the promise I don't know and you like and I'll leave it to the user interface to figure out I could see that but. To kind of see your diagnoses side by side with the active problem list that you can compare and kind of. Reconcile those two lists I guess. Right. 

00:17:21;28 - 00:17:28;28 | F4
Yeah because you don't want to lose like the antibiotic because that's an important part of this patient's diagnosis right. 

00:17:28;28 - 00:17:42;02 | F6
Right. But normally the TBI. Areas that don't know how this will eventually. Be represented like. Today would normally be a separate thing on the list not included with them. Right. That was. 

00:17:43;15 - 00:17:49;28 | F1
Right straight. You know the little hopper that we have represented right now like normally they would be. 

00:17:49;28 - 00:17:59;03 | F3
And then you'd be flagged as suspected rather than confirmed. Right and then you have live laceration as another data and then you have DTIC you actually have one string of. 

00:17:59;18 - 00:18:04;09 | F14
The combination of things. Yes. So another factor. 

00:18:05;23 - 00:19:53;08 | M2
I think. I think what's happening is. That those it's happening in different stages of the cognitive process right. So in some cases but no this is basically a finding. Right. Right. It could be eye lacerations like a surgical finding. Is the diagnoses because you observe. The actual injury it. Does because of that. So you're basically saying it's subjective. Fighting another case. It's a deductive process right. You have a system and you suspect something you know some kind of condition. And. You know any explanation that might be relevant is some type of disorder. The irony. Cornea whatever the case I don't see that happened until the note is being. Proposed. The guy just based on the findings I think this is you know maybe the bottom line is you know we do testing. To confirm that diagnosis or you know or not but. So you help. The. Process and diagnostic findings. You know depends on the situation. It could happen. Immediately upon a Friday like we had with the scans that we had to see on our body. And you know the faster you see the eye. There it is. You just got it. That's notes that in that case it's been noted that the synthesis that you got to see the go go back and find those things quickly synthesize those into a narrative that this is the findings of my assessment of the patient. In other cases that is something that doesn't even happen until the note actually decompose. So I missed a moment ago at which point the doctor is saying this is what I think it is. And I just want testing for the side that he was wrong. Either way. It can happen in the process. 

00:19:54;07 - 00:20:06;12 | F2
Like for example is like as a doctor. A lot of times I only come up with a preliminary diagnosis and then. You know I've met a patient to surgery or medicine and they keep forgetting that he's not like I might. Put it you know. 

00:20:07;13 - 00:21:29;15 | F3
Hypoxia you know shortness of breath and isolating my you know precast like suspected you know or suspected pulmonary embolism or something like that. The next trade is pending the patient Batal that they get admitted in and I sign off on my health before those tests have resulted in the hospitalist that takes the a patient. Followed up this has resulted in their diagnosis is more severe like can be acquired ammonia or something. But then what the problem is is that I think whatever mine was they shortness of breath it's on the top right on the top and then the house with the thinking it might get passed on the problem. But the. Same process or phenomenon that's happening with the patients. They just kind of like duplication. Of each other and there's no way to reconcile that so we can. You know. Use our ukase to figure out a really nifty user friendly way of reconciling POMALYST in real time because that is you can easily be far ahead of other humans. So we've got separate sprints where we're. Addressing. And bringing out the diagnoses. Citing the will show it. In both places. 

00:21:30;20 - 00:21:33;03 | M4
And usability. 

00:21:34;04 - 00:21:50;15 | F3
Yes that's a great idea and I think you know just for the time being just to keep moving forward. You know just. Let's just try to come up with whatever needs to be in the top right now so that it makes sense with the way we're flying to represent this in the future. And then in the future role we'll test it. 

00:21:51;19 - 00:22:04;15 | F15
On the Internet. Yes. Now. You. Say. Your. Friends are. Going to be. 31. Three. Years. 

00:22:05;08 - 00:22:06;09 | M10
Right. One in three. To me. 

00:22:10;23 - 00:22:16;29 | M4
So yeah I will do what you said trying to this consistent until Friday. It's consistent with that. 

00:22:17;09 - 00:22:22;02 | F3
Concept. And I want to control the process. You know. 

00:22:23;06 - 00:22:27;02 | M6
You might take what you think could be a puppet. Well. 

00:22:27;18 - 00:22:31;14 | M10
We need to make a decision. 

00:22:31;04 - 00:22:52;24 | M4
We need to decide when because it's good to see a lot of prep work to us something else being set up. So I think after tomorrow and during our backlog Roumi let's. Bring up the topic and let's try to. Use. That time. And start thinking about what what is with someone who is just as well. 

00:22:54;10 - 00:23:06;10 | F16
And we're who. OK so do you I mean keep going through the dark. Side. Ground. 

00:23:11;08 - 00:23:54;13 | F9
Continually frustrated by the lack of clicking and what you're seeing. Joss's. So we're continuing to enter the distance. Visual acuity. The pupil measurements I think is that we're yeah people measurements. Like. I don't know how we sort of want to describe or. Explain more. Work which was. Before we see it. As. A. That's. 

00:23:56;03 - 00:24:11;16 | F18
Right. But the language is maybe. You guys Tom enjoy your understanding. 

00:24:15;14 - 00:24:25;24 | F5
What is the rest of the way of doing that is very hard because you remember those those exams we had. Right. 

00:24:26;18 - 00:24:39;10 | F6
This is it right here. HEADLEE. So yeah it's like the widget whatever that is. Sending it. I don't know what you want to call that little son shaped thing. So yeah. 

00:24:40;19 - 00:24:58;08 | F2
It's not consistent with what you're seeing here because normally that means that it's populated and you're supposed to be populating that template and you're supposed to fill it out. Minuter checkbox that means the completed. You know it's there and you feel that out already and then if it's grey with a box that means it might be relevant but it's not. 

00:24:59;10 - 00:25:10;27 | F12
Showing up. And. Then if you want to add things and take something that is from a different. Content with what do you get when you get to that big. 

00:25:12;16 - 00:25:14;21 | F6
Thing. Nasher terminology. 

00:25:17;22 - 00:25:30;20 | F2
But just what should look like on the screen right is that all of the victims that I agree with a little or whatever that is here should all be showing up identically. And I've just held off on. 

00:25:31;13 - 00:25:38;29 | F19
Putting all these ads and every side. It doesn't change to one. Yes besides just Eisley. 

00:25:41;03 - 00:25:47;08 | F18
Until we get the latest. Yes. All right. 

00:25:49;02 - 00:25:51;28 | F2
Is any sense when you think about that. 

00:25:53;20 - 00:26:01;13 | M13
Well I'm still a little bit wrong. Sorry. So. First of all I'm a bit confused by the word binding. 

00:26:02;09 - 00:26:15;17 | M2
Because that's what this is. This includes That's right. What would be one of these. That's right. But. Am I right. Am I wrong about that. The physical exam. Is going to be. 

00:26:17;18 - 00:26:24;18 | F2
Not so physical. I think it just has to be performed by the ophthalmologist at the bedside. Not like a formal. OK. 

00:26:24;29 - 00:26:27;19 | M3
OK. OK. Thank you. All right. 

00:26:30;02 - 00:26:36;17 | F2
Maybe you should take physical exam findings and clarify what I said. Yes. 

00:26:38;29 - 00:27:01;08 | M2
Got your findings associated with other things. Lab results. You know teachers can't. So you want to take the physical exam that makes a lot of sense to me. So the way this works is it speech that is going to be present in this person's workflow. 

00:27:01;10 - 00:27:18;25 | M9
He clicks on a little something and the Templestowe that exam shows up correct. Yes. On everything all the snow that are green is something which is here. Which is something this is in the process. 

00:27:20;22 - 00:27:25;04 | F21
They are present. You just don't see someone bubble. 

00:27:25;18 - 00:27:33;20 | F9
So maybe that would aid the user if they saw us explaining that. Why do you not see any closer. 

00:27:34;19 - 00:27:48;13 | F20
To being boring now. Well once you get one to solidify. The representation of the other than you would that every side because there's a change and when it's just. 

00:27:49;11 - 00:27:52;24 | F18
You can be wrong. And that's to change every step besides on. 

00:27:54;16 - 00:28:18;03 | F2
The basis of what you should be saying right now. If you were actually represented you see your degree with the gear and people should be green with the gear and the rest should be gray with the box right here the green people green color green. But then also on the on the side you see color. 

00:28:18;21 - 00:28:23;02 | F21
And a shirt on her visit to the people they are present. 

00:28:23;15 - 00:28:35;23 | F9
But isn't it true that everything that's green or the exams that are our context sensitive for these patients what they should be green and they should all be. No no no. All right so then I have it backwards. 

00:28:37;21 - 00:28:43;13 | M9
So Angry Birds of Prey. 

00:28:43;24 - 00:28:47;24 | F19
They've been added. I'm crying. Yeah I agree. 

00:28:48;05 - 00:28:58;20 | M4
It really means it means that you're actually seeing the exam section in the wind so you need that. That's what it means. 

00:28:58;05 - 00:29:01;05 | M2
Give it up there what. How did that get. 

00:29:02;25 - 00:29:06;29 | F2
It's on the complete radar. The reason for the encounter. 

00:29:07;05 - 00:29:54;14 | M4
Yes. Yes it's based on the exactly what we're doing is we're looking at the diagnoses for the patient. Right now. To set that context. To trauma. So this is. What we work on Baseer of problem contact. So you know the patient can be you know glaucoma problem context to be diagnosed with that. Yes. So Wernberg right now we have a rule that those diagnoses the patient says this you can't hear from his patients ocular trauma. And that's it says that. That list. That the provider sees initially. And then they can. Know from that list they can. 

00:29:55;04 - 00:30:13;02 | M17
Turn on or off exams by clicking on. If you click on it it turns green and that turns it on it adds it to the line. If you click it again it turns it green and lose it from the line. And then if you want to add exams that are not part list the click on that exam dropped down. And then. 

00:30:15;12 - 00:30:26;04 | M4
So. So again is the system suggesting. But allowing the user to. Override that is just any changes at any time. 

00:30:26;04 - 00:30:40;21 | M2
The fact is that that could ever happen again. What do you think that's acquisitions. You know it's something like what you just said or Ray. Just had a good grade whatever you want from it whatever whatever you want it. 

00:30:41;13 - 00:30:54;04 | M3
And to have it show up and answer the data that it stays on the screen that it looks a little wanted. So there is a better idea. Well we thought about that and what we sort of wait. 

00:30:55;01 - 00:32:01;26 | M4
Is the fact that OK you present the list of exam that could be potentially part of that contest. And they all agreed that the user. Every time that's where they're going to have to do much of clicks to show those these intersections. Now just because those exam sections are showing their grief doesn't mean the user has to perform that exam. That even ignore that. Their exams right. The recommendations that leave that exam section late and finish the encounter without documenting the ideal pupil. For this nation for whatever reason. They could leave those Shuling on the street in street they could leave that line and it won't. That fighting them will be included in the camera. What concerns me is that. Some of these exact components are thought by many cases run by a counselor or a staff member of a technician like Kakuei a pupil baby. Color. But that other Strudal. Volatility I put last. 

00:32:02;20 - 00:32:08;24 | M2
By a physician. So I'm confused about you know I'll be deciding what I need. 

00:32:08;27 - 00:32:19;07 | F2
Good good doctor. This decision still has to wait for medical legal reasons for delay. He'll have to. Document that greatly detailed QAD even if they don't measure it directly himself. 

00:32:20;13 - 00:32:39;22 | F1
So no I agree. Where do we pull that. Where is that goes round from the out of the system. That the physician physician agrees with me to be done for the patient and that work is allocated between the. Clinical Staff. 

00:32:40;15 - 00:33:06;24 | M2
Was helping him and his own examination. That's great. I mean I think that's probably the best situation. Maybe that's which is a Sunday. You're. Just. Not not the standard up not been because I think it's a good question. It's. Going to be because the best way to do it. Be curious to see how. How something like a jack Bargo or. Gagliano would react to this. 

00:33:07;13 - 00:33:21;14 | F1
I mean sadistic like he's something to like when he gets back on Friday doesn't seem to react positively to it. That is on the form. You know what I did because my feel for me. 

00:33:22;04 - 00:33:47;09 | M18
You said something like I wanted to follow up on you said that the position is testing is a show in which older. I'm not. Is it is it true the contract is passed around Casey switches. So so to David's point slide 7. I think what Dean is asking for is. If you could take a look at this scene. 

00:33:48;05 - 00:34:06;25 | M4
Because you know there is nothing there is potential for confusion. Take a look at this and see if you could. Improve on or you think it's the best way to present it to the testers. Preachers together. Yeah. But. I'm actually still confused because. 

00:34:07;20 - 00:34:22;10 | F9
If if it's the recommended test they should be angry. Is that what you're saying. I think the chilling phrase recommended by me. Ok I thought that was different from our base here where. 

00:34:23;11 - 00:34:35;02 | M18
I was once said so some could understand. It shows a. Sign of great Supreme's systems trying to guess which ones the physicians probably going to select based on like noses. 

00:34:35;28 - 00:35:05;23 | F2
Okay. My understanding was that for example it is like that the trauma context straight to them and maybe correct me if I'm wrong but my understanding is that for trauma either below trauma being right there gold colored. So all of these exams that you see whether they're green or gray. Either way they always show up when it's a calm patient and there are certain ones were on auto populate or it automatically be green. 

00:35:07;21 - 00:35:12;14 | F6
Based on the diagnosis which is more specific than the general context of comments that right. 

00:35:13;08 - 00:35:16;22 | F19
Yes I'm not mistaken. Based on the writer's. 

00:35:16;29 - 00:35:53;04 | M17
Reference yes. So the other part of this that we haven't gotten to yet is that. You know. This is going to be a default configuration for the trauma. Tablet in the dashboard. That can figures many things the workflow checklist for physical exam be. But the provider in any one always has the key to customize so they say. As a trauma as a low key ophthalmologist and. And. Comcast or hospital. I always. 

00:35:53;22 - 00:36:26;28 | M4
Perform these exams. They're going to have to customize that and save it as a customized template. Under their settings. And then one day when they see a patient bill use their customized. Version of the traumatic. Were. But were working to get we'll get to the that those user preference. Configuration capabilities later. What we're trying to do now is just. Assess the usability of. The. 

00:36:28;29 - 00:37:51;17 | M20
Configuration. I think I would. Get what I would do. Under that chart would it make sense for me anyway would make sense if it would improve things if you separated the list in two segments. Segment that is related. To the to the functioning of the guy. So you no visibility the IAC Building waited to respond and so on which can be done typically by people who are not the position. Of example have done by this efficient Funder's external. Foot lamp. Maybe even široki ultrasound for sure. Those are the kinds of exams that had buttons by clinicians by physicians. I think that. Because it's so common in this field to have. You know have technicians do the you know the traditional acuity to both kinds of exams using machines that just recording what subjective findings they get for the patients. That have that physicians do. These are the kinds of exams. That will double check mark between the acuity and pupil in color. I would say a lot like this so I can see. It it may not be as he when trying to do. 

00:37:52;12 - 00:37:56;20 | M14
This for mobility. Example we've been to South Africa all the. 

00:37:57;15 - 00:38:19;16 | F8
Time to account for what you're saying. This top section of the physical exam section might even be enough to swim lanes one for you know the lower level provider and the second something the physio. I mean I just you know I get to see that the apology. For we have to do the kinds of dance we have functioning. 

00:38:19;29 - 00:38:57;24 | M2
The Samsa that we have morphological or physical exams where you're looking is not it's an objective as opposed to a subjective exam. So. It's acuity to bold color. Motility color. Competition steel you get all of the sun. And the others are not. I just think there are separate kinds of things you're kind of pushed up. I just think it might be useful to have separated. Yes I guess the question is how do you label. Groups. 

00:39:02;07 - 00:39:26;06 | M3
Functioning as. I mean to me I may be enjoying it but it is there that this will be a joke I guess. But but the visual functioning is good in the apology for the beaver. We have visual functioning and we have sort of a logical exam. So for example you know with what's changed about the physical properties of the coin land that eyelid. 

00:39:27;12 - 00:39:45;29 | M6
On that's that visible. The fact that you know it's visible through examination conflict land so photography office and so on. But you don't have to use those terms that the data may not be the correct term in the field about the analogy but I'm sure there. Is a correct way to say this but it's. 

00:39:46;15 - 00:40:43;26 | F2
Good that he did get to hear that again. And I'm not here now like every Sedgley has their own convention border examinations but like Nanami. You know I document in a more general you know this on the feeling that the physical exam in order is like starting with General repetitive and I know that it creeps people out but you rearrange the order. Frank you said you're taking your documents straight in order and you kind of developing it does he with always doing the same in the same pattern. So it may be good to talk to them about what is preferred with them you know how they would. Label or categorize Hetty's in there. That also I guess you can figure it out at the beginning you can kind of take a guess at what the clinician would probably want something to get and then it can figure it in or do they want. To that it meets their needs. 

00:40:46;13 - 00:41:32;05 | M4
A lower class. Dr. Varga Yeah I can almost envision this already with like. If there were to some lanes and whether or not there was a technician if the technician is there they use the same functionality if they're not it just collapses it disappears. Or. Just. Or just keep them separate because they are they are of a different type setup and that is its role in the dependent because what we heard is that there are some settings where the Outlaws will. Perform all in there so we don't have CT. So. We asked. Jack. How the label goes but. Said Tommy. 

00:41:33;12 - 00:41:45;09 | M18
Questions so you're in a situation where the technician just a couple slams into position. Now you want to. Automatically display exams. 

00:41:45;17 - 00:41:53;11 | M5
Technician yes yes yes yes yeah yeah that's right. That's a good counter. 

00:41:53;24 - 00:42:14;27 | M4
So they open the account and they'll see it. So regardless of who performed what they were seeing the patient they perform a couple of exams the guide roughly got all the. They go back to that piece of the encounter they'll see. The results. The findings really sensitive information. They. Take. 

00:42:15;12 - 00:42:35;09 | M12
Pictures just one more question so it was positioned because first you need some sound findings because the technicians see what the position is at the same way for the technicians so you see if they open up the encounter in your case well maybe the opposition would want to prevent the technicians. 

00:42:36;09 - 00:42:52;05 | F9
This is the base here where the physician has the ability to accept or not accept the technicians measures so so so so inefficient cases you will see something says a technician who seems to accept. 

00:42:52;12 - 00:42:58;02 | M12
That's another issue. Well we'll see it they'll see. That. Unexampled. 

00:42:58;06 - 00:43:05;03 | M4
Perform we'll see who performed it. They have the ability to remove them before they finalize the encounter. 

00:43:07;05 - 00:43:19;22 | F9
Right. I don't remember which was every person was but they said it may be somebody who's you know not in this scenario but it might be a resident it might be somebody who's not been on the job long and they don't have confidence in their work. 

00:43:19;22 - 00:43:47;05 | M4
Now the system even though that exam was performed doesn't go on the final counter of the system it's still on and still they're stored in the database. Right. There's a lot saying that. That. Exam was. Moved. So has the full record of. Everything that happened. But. The physician has the final say of. What. Exam findings they want to find common. 

00:43:48;26 - 00:44:06;28 | M23
With would you consider putting something on this that his physician can walk. Something. That the technician can't get it. The stress. Position. Go back and double check everything with him. So so if you if you perform an exam. You perform a visual acuity. 

00:44:07;11 - 00:44:11;08 | M4
And that exam finding to safety database. 

00:44:11;09 - 00:44:13;16 | F9
You can't modify somebody can't go in and overnight and never. 

00:44:13;18 - 00:44:31;04 | M4
You can modify that because that exam was for for. That's right. You know. You can't go back in time right. And. Can't change that. Or you could do is think it is incorrect for any reason. You they don't trust providers. 

00:44:31;17 - 00:44:42;15 | M17
Perform wrong. It was a malfunctioning. Equipment for whatever reason they can remove it. And not include encountered. But it always seems in the database. 

00:44:45;03 - 00:45:01;03 | M23
That whenever someone or something close things are safe there it's like they think they have to revise. MRS. By the way is ontology as it is now. Will be used the word back to the functioning in hostile structures. 

00:45:02;04 - 00:45:10;27 | M3
Just infighting fighting the structure at the top if that's the correct way to say that's the way we get it to be remodeled that's what we have. 

00:45:11;28 - 00:45:19;11 | M4
When I asked Jack I'll just tell him that this house I didn't find to be heard. 

00:45:19;27 - 00:45:44;21 | M5
So the funds will be OK. So it just happens to be you know the point of functioning we have Fishbach security fields pupils redeploy conversions motility efforts of accommodation. Colour. Structures has got everything out but you know the. Two segments Naciri a segment of the components of those you know the lead you know the cornea the lid the lens. Pupils. 

00:45:45;15 - 00:45:51;19 | M20
You know vitreous that kind of stuff. You said those. Are. 

00:45:51;28 - 00:46:08;19 | M21
OK. This is from the bottom chart. That was to be. This. Is the Beaver a policy that I'm sure you had at one point that said that again. It's. 

00:46:13;08 - 00:46:21;02 | F8
So you. That's a. That's a golazo Shilluk you got through. 

00:46:21;27 - 00:46:41;12 | F22
I mean actually how how does they even have some homework to do that it kind of works out or which we. If anyone has suggestions about 5 7. If we can improve the explanation of. Workflow. With. It. 

00:46:41;29 - 00:46:57;15 | M13
Is the proper context. Well what I mean. I mean is that the notion that. The. Problem context. Drives the choiceless the past. You know. What. We should. 

00:46:58;07 - 00:47:23;02 | M4
Be whether or not we see proud as you just mentioned it sounds like something is seriously what it is. Please. Explain how it's. All right. Plus you know is you're going to include TBI. That the problem concepts should include the TBI function which includes binocular functions like. 

00:47:23;22 - 00:47:45;09 | M9
You point convergence. That's the kind of stuff. Right. I mean that's something that you know. One of the solutions might be able to. Make better but I know that. There's a high degree of correlation between. TBI. And. Reading. Dysfunctions that are. 

00:47:45;25 - 00:48:38;08 | M2
Associated with binocular with disorders that are trusted. Color is one of those and then also. Stirred up very upset. You know the ability for the ice to work together. Pursuits the that kind of thing. So waiting to work together. And it also demonstrated poor reading. Poor reading ability that is also measurable like a vicious type anomaly. So. I just think that if you were to use the context the problem. Is at least the find list of options for the test. Should it be consistent with that with those faculties including that TBI one. Okay when I send Jack the Question about the grouping of the exams I'll ask him. 

00:48:38;22 - 00:48:41;16 | M4
If we should add any exams. 

00:48:42;02 - 00:49:09;25 | M21
Does he get perfect. Yes. Moving on. To the next so many slides just go through. 

00:49:12;02 - 00:49:27;29 | F9
And actually should we. Was this a decision point. David you're going to keep this as just arms showing no. Minimal number of exams or. Filling up the white space with more sounds. Sure it. 

00:49:30;15 - 00:49:32;15 | F17
Does. 

00:49:32;25 - 00:49:45;05 | F21
You'll see as you pick it it in the car and start. Yes these two at this point. He's a nice guy. OK. OK. 

00:50:00;04 - 00:50:05;22 | F17
Colors. So was now. It's. 

00:50:06;06 - 00:50:13;02 | M4
The red. Yeah I think we've got we've got to get along. Very. 

00:50:14;22 - 00:50:24;09 | F17
Well dressed in 30. Guess they will be drawn. We don't. 

00:50:25;05 - 00:51:13;14 | M4
Want to get this out. He'll be on the list and perform but there are too many exams to dress on one's spring. So be on the list. But it won't be the jam would actually be performed until. Spring. And I had a comment about these. Checks. They just seemed. To be more bold could they send out a little more. In some. Way. Just see. Oh. You said. Grab me visually. Race. Color. 

00:51:13;21 - 00:51:38;08 | F11
Or gold or something. You are so right. I am. Going. Visually. We. Factor. 

00:51:39;24 - 00:52:12;19 | F18
The Field. And. I. Actually have another. But the survey. And. The findings we got. Were. Pretty lengthy. On. This. Point. The. T-shirt only allowed for. You know. Three. Haircare. So. I'll be. Working. 

00:52:14;03 - 00:52:30;10 | M2
One. Yeah I think it is. Is it your is it your view that you need to have. The same Springside or for. You. You know you are combining them like this. Sarah. 

00:52:32;26 - 00:52:40;24 | M4
You know we can we can so we should focus on one example and get my bike that you have to be happy. 

00:52:40;25 - 00:53:26;17 | M2
First of all let me say I'm like really huge. I mean it's like the it's the big the big mamak day right and the whole thing you see the buses and you can see the and how clear you can see with the. And you've got to Thilakan if you have a dilated idling somewhere in here and say what is violated are not violated. So that's in there somewhere. But if something is violated violated I. You're looking at you know the back of the eye here. So. I'm assuming. This could be a very very happy. Examination I would not try to squeeze it in between. But I hope you have a safe flight. 

00:53:26;17 - 00:53:31;16 | F4
I I mean anyway to be moral is stretching it out. 

00:53:32;10 - 00:53:46;29 | M2
Yeah. Jack said this is a lot of stuff. This is the whole. This is the options for them. What's wrong with the eyes. It. Really is. It is not covered by functioning as a physical exam. 

00:53:48;12 - 00:53:56;21 | M4
Yes. We'll definitely focus on what you see. You will see multiple sections of on screen time. 

00:53:57;11 - 00:54:27;02 | M10
All these warnings in terms of. And. I think. The way Jack exams. For this sprint for Sprint 29. Is handset or done pre dilation. And then. And then will dilate high and the always hands. Free 30. 

00:54:28;11 - 00:54:36;29 | M14
Post. Ah OK. OK. But you should say that at least that's basically the anterior segment. 

00:54:38;09 - 00:54:43;29 | M15
Right it's the front part of the eye. Yes. Yes. 

00:54:44;12 - 00:55:00;21 | F26
Fairly. I mean I don't know. I mean whatever Jack wants the guys to do what I mean a lot of times you. Could do that but he's got to use them without violating the eye but. Maybe. Asking. What. Footwear. 

00:55:03;12 - 00:55:06;16 | F27
Was it fun. Does this look like. 

00:55:10;24 - 00:55:46;06 | F6
To me right. Yes you could you could look at this. Yeah I mean you couldn't get into. Anything. I don't know. If you're right. But. If you stopped to go where. It's fine. You're going to dilute the eyes anyway. You wouldn't do it to document it twice. All right. I'm my. Understanding that you don't really need to dilate the eyes is. To get. The. So. 

00:55:48;11 - 00:55:58;17 | F9
Basically your last line. So where do we stand that we've got to be primarily oriented towards the documentation of the HP. 

00:56:00;17 - 00:56:03;14 | M2
By the retina specialist. 

00:56:03;25 - 00:56:06;10 | F14
Yes. Okay okay got it. 

00:56:12;02 - 00:56:29;04 | M25
Yes. So what more focus than. Some of our previous friends are using multiple things. Yes Tristan and. The whole Braford thing. Going back right after. That. Staff. A. 

00:56:29;16 - 00:57:19;07 | M2
Lot of work. I. Think. That. Audacious violation. You know I'm. Speaking with a segment. Of the base here. Just prepress with the byly if you can see the back end and you could look at the back of the eye. Was the night before he started the examination. And talked with a patient about it and checked that he had basically. Used the time efficiently because it takes a few minutes for the dilates to actually take place you know to actually occur. So he actually. Would not and would not be doing it the same way. Think that he would do it which is you know they do a pre dilation exam that happens at least exam. Which is to go ahead time the Heinsius that's what he described what we talked to him. On. 

00:57:19;13 - 00:57:28;23 | M26
The. I do remember the. News that he said Yeah but the drop said it doesn't say it thought that would be. 

00:57:30;05 - 00:57:49;03 | M21
The one. So just so you know that. That might be an option at some point that you may have to. Be able to support. Anyone. In. The system that will. Prevent. That kind of. 

00:57:51;19 - 00:57:54;29 | M26
So bright. And the fact that we're. 

00:57:57;08 - 00:58:06;07 | F17
Using to add lines in dilution status. Well I think so just. 

00:58:07;11 - 00:58:09;29 | M9
Topoint it. Yes exactly. 

00:58:10;02 - 00:58:17;05 | M2
It should be. I think it should be noted that some point when you have a result. But with the way the done should be. 

00:58:20;06 - 00:58:26;26 | M16
You have a great idea. Ending. 

00:58:27;02 - 00:58:43;24 | M27
That report. When and the drugs were administered. On the side of the sun or in the slit lamp exam some sort of dilution. Status. 

00:58:44;29 - 00:59:03;08 | M20
You'll have to take. QUESTION We do the IP right yes. If it's good to be gold you can have. You got a kind of aesthetic. Yeah. 

00:59:03;12 - 00:59:39;03 | M26
That's true. Actually with. Jack pointed out is that. Because of the condition of the left my. Left eye is already pharmacologically Kylie because. The patients on Andrew. So. You have the documentation of the pupil exam. You able to do that for the right eye with a left eye and just documents. You know. Left five. People pharmacologically dilated. So it can't have Judge reactivity. Because it's hard because on average. 

00:59:40;02 - 01:00:17;29 | M25
Lifetime. So we'll always get questions from me enjoy start working on the improvements. This is like. Maquette should we really. Should we. Do we need to get back together and need to just. Treat back for. One last review. 

01:00:18;28 - 01:00:21;29 | F17
When we schedule. 

01:00:23;10 - 01:00:33;09 | F4
So. Said Joyce said you work on the questions today and David will work on these updates. Updates. 

01:00:35;10 - 01:00:51;24 | F15
Of her. Bounced back. From. And shit I haven't sent it yet but should I could send out an invite to hold Friday at. 10 12 3. 

01:00:52;12 - 01:00:59;22 | F22
Or not. I think that's kind of pushing it. It might be pushing it. 

01:01:03;02 - 01:01:10;12 | F9
I don't know it's up to you guys. I mean I can send it out and just it's better to have it reserved and then cancel. Then not reserve it. 

01:01:12;08 - 01:01:15;15 | F27
Really. You want it. To. 

01:01:16;14 - 01:01:23;02 | F2
You want to try for a Friday. You want to try. It maybe give us a offer of the weekend and do it on Monday. 

01:01:23;29 - 01:01:35;28 | F10
Yes whatever you guys are comfortable with. I'm just wanting to get your feedback about whether I should send a hold this time to our testers for this Friday or. 

01:01:36;14 - 01:01:45;17 | M25
Not. You do know. The holiday Monday is a holiday. We are sent review. 

01:01:45;17 - 01:02:01;08 | F26
I just think that that just get your take today when we can take the time. So I think we should take the time that. We can commit to right the but and time we can commit to it not change at all. Absolutely. We're not getting things done. I don't think that comes across all right. 

01:02:01;08 - 01:02:10;23 | F10
What we did tentatively say this Friday at 10:00 but it all depends on our time. 12 your time. 3:00 east coast time. But. 

01:02:11;16 - 01:02:16;02 | F22
You know it just depends on can we get the work done to prepare for this in time. 

01:02:19;22 - 01:02:49;08 | F2
I have to question somebody I don't know what I mean by the the month before it's part of the whole thing you know all the little changes and tweaks and everything. So this slice. Theory I've. Done. Before you. Find. Optimistic but I would say that. 

01:02:50;02 - 01:02:55;22 | M4
The schedule for Wednesday. I think we were pretty. Sure that we can get it done by Wednesday. 

01:02:56;09 - 01:03:06;29 | M25
And what we did for 29 was guess what for Wednesday I scale the test once. No no no. Next Wednesday a week from let's say OK. 

01:03:07;12 - 01:03:29;16 | M4
Yeah OK. The day after the sprint. OK. And then. What we can do is you know if we get. Done with. Sprint 29 sooner than. Next Wednesday. And start on. Sprint. We. Start to prep work for Sprint. So we're not. We're not losing time wasting any time. 

01:03:36;14 - 01:03:47;18 | F2
Whatever you get I mean I can be available and ready when on Wednesday or Friday or whenever. Really. Well like you said Julie I'd rather. 

01:03:48;11 - 01:03:54;28 | M17
Come into a time and see to it you know any time out of your schedule. 

01:03:55;29 - 01:03:58;10 | F7
OK so Wednesday the 21st. 

01:03:58;29 - 01:04:09;13 | M2
We have. The other thing is Europe you have got to have the feedback from the left right. Right. We need to get that. Yeah that's supposed to come in by close of business tomorrow. 

01:04:10;19 - 01:04:16;11 | M28
Tomorrow. So. He'll give us a chance to reflect on that. All right. 

01:04:17;24 - 01:04:23;15 | M11
So you know what it what it was like. Yeah. 

01:04:26;10 - 01:04:54;27 | F9
OK so we do Wednesday the 21st. Delaying the backlog roaming meeting that 11. Kidnap star be delayed by half an hour and then we'll use that time before that from 10 to 11 30 are time for that usability testing. Just. Throwing that out there. You don't mind. Working. Your private lunch. 

01:05:08;24 - 01:05:10;22 | F2
If you want to do it after the. 

01:05:10;22 - 01:05:29;05 | F7
Don't do that you are going to save it. No. Well then it gets kind of late for our East Coast friends. So says we'll I mean if we do the testing before the backlog or meaning that we can roll right into that meeting. Because it's mostly the same on. 

01:05:29;29 - 01:05:33;14 | F14
A month I think we could do it that way. But. 

01:05:34;20 - 01:05:43;02 | M6
Given that you're not worried about Friday. No we haven't to the feedback yet from Yakovlev's. These folks. 

01:05:43;22 - 01:06:03;12 | F8
OK. It sounds like a plan. So Joyal said the questions they will work with David will work on the screenshots and I'll send up the invite. And once I got the questions from Joy I will. Create will actually. Interim create a worksheet. 

01:06:03;27 - 01:06:04;14 | F22
